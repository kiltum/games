# Good old games

At sometime I want to play to very old game. Ping-Pong, Tetris, Arcanoid, you know it!

But quick googling told me, that I need to set up emulators of pay some money. 
Actually, my nostalgia not so big for this. But I still want to play :)

So I decide to re-create my favorite games as I remember them. And for fun, I will try
to do this on Qt. So you can compile and run this games on any device that can run with Qt.

P.S.Yes, I know that we are 
remember different variations of the same game. Atari, Commodore, Sinclair ZX ...
