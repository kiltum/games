# PingPong

Here is a very simple game


https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/818bcbd6fc8f1172653603a793ce31716fbeb864

Here is first commit. I add Ball as a simple red rectangle 10x10, Pole as blue rectangle 400x400
and put Ball at the middle of Pole or at 200x200

Now I add Timer with 50ms tick. On every tick Ball moved and them I check boundaries.
For easier control a move Ball inside Pole rectangle

What a game withoud sound? Grab free sound and set to play it on every wall hit. Testing
with a permanent "ping" is terrible, so I add "mute" option

Add a Racket with reaction to key "UP" and "DOWN"

https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/16b2d45f116ac2887f974e792fabcf4bd7123747

Make hitting of the bal to the wall much better visually. And ball now does not has height and width
properties, only size.

Increase speed of ball and first version of function, that check hitting Ball on Rocket

https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/0354a175be9ad888a905c1dd5c66654d84a9a368

Add "fail" sound

https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/a53903f2ea73ea6ff51917b3859a5daa73df4653

Block Racket movement after fail

https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/a743f54a8d57f2f584ef431f0e0cd3afd6995ee1

Nice touches to Pole and add Score table

https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/9a154df0816268cd9c0c7198538870331ab52386

Add start sound and free re-run of the game

https://github.com/kiltum/games/commit/3112abc229462777840d08ec3288658e268de3cf

Fixing bug, when Ball hit Pole at bottom near Rocket. And now Ball bounce from Rocket
much better. 

And for hard core, after ever ball bounce size of ball decreased, and speed increased

Have fun!
